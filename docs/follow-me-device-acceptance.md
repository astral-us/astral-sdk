# Follow-Me Physical Device Acceptance

**Status:** Not run: rover hardware unavailable in this session.

Automated simulator tests do not establish LiDAR projection accuracy or prove that the physical rover stops when commanded. Before using follow mode around people, test the current build on a supervised, LiDAR-capable iPhone mounted on the rover in a clear space:

1. With cloud connectivity disabled, type `follow me` and tap Send once. Verify rear-camera acquisition stops on a person or after at most 360°.
2. Verify the rover maintains approximately 1.5 m distance and does not drive backward when the person is too close.
3. Introduce a second person in the image centre. Verify the original track remains locked, or the rover pauses on ambiguity.
4. Briefly hide the person. Verify forward motion stops before reacquisition rotation; keep the person lost and verify follow mode stops within 10 seconds.
5. In each active state, press Stop Following; also test typed and spoken `stop`. Verify motor stop acknowledgement and no delayed restart.
6. Leave Talk, background the app, and trigger a navigation failure. Verify the rover stops before another mode can drive.

Record the tested phone, rover, build revision, pass/fail per step, and redacted runtime-log evidence here after the supervised run. Do not attach camera images or raw transcripts.
