# Silent Search: Optical Two-Rover Search

**Date:** 2026-08-11
**Base:** `main` at `2f2eedc`

## Goal

Deliver a constrained, repeatable two-rover demonstration in which two iPhone Pro–equipped WAVE ROVERs search complementary sectors without cloud services, shared Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or radio communication between phones. The rovers coordinate only by scanning QR codes displayed on one another's screens.

The v1 demonstration must calibrate both independent ARKit sessions into one shared mission frame, divide an unknown indoor space into west and east search sectors, search those sectors through LiDAR-derived frontier exploration, exchange a confirmed target coordinate at a timed rendezvous, and drive both rovers to role-specific stand-off poses around the target.

## Product Behavior

- Each phone connects only to its own rover's ESP32 access point.
- The operator explicitly configures one app instance as Rover A and the other as Rover B.
- Both rovers calibrate against the same printed floor marker before exchanging mission data.
- Rover A searches the west half-plane and Rover B searches the east half-plane.
- The target is one object class supported by the bundled RoverYOLO model.
- Both rovers return to separate rendezvous staging poses at the agreed deadline. A finder may return early and wait safely.
- The finder reports a shared-frame target coordinate by QR code. The peer acknowledges it, and a final optical commit releases both rovers to converge.
- Both screens display `FOUND` only after their own navigation reaches the assigned target stand-off pose.
- If neither rover confirms the target, both stop after exchanging terminal not-found status.

## Architecture

The feature is a deterministic subsystem in `PhroverKit`. It does not depend on a language model and does not adapt `RoverTeamRadio`, whose continuous-radio semantics do not match intermittent optical exchange.

### `SilentSearchCoordinator`

Owns the mission state machine and terminal result. It depends on narrow protocols for calibration, optical exchange, exploration, target tracking, motion, and time. It never sends wheel commands directly; all movement goes through `NavigationController`, preserving the existing obstacle, communication, and progress safety checks.

The coordinator exposes state and diagnostics suitable for SwiftUI without importing UI concerns into the mission implementation.

### `SharedMissionFrame`

Represents a session-local rigid transform between ARKit's navigation plane and mission coordinates. The printed floor marker's center is `(0, 0)`. Mission `x` increases east, mission `y` increases north along the marker's printed arrow, and heading zero points north with positive angles counterclockwise. Rover A's west sector is `x < -0.25 m`; Rover B's east sector is `x > 0.25 m`. The center exclusion band is not searchable.

Calibration detects the marker's oriented QR corners, grounds them with LiDAR, and derives origin, heading, and observed physical size. It uses exactly one observation per AR frame and accepts after three observations from distinct frames within two seconds. Every observed origin must be within 0.10 m of the component-wise median origin, every heading within 5 degrees of the circular mean heading, and every observed width within 15 percent of the configured 0.20 m marker width. The transform is invalidated by an AR session reset or unrecovered tracking loss and is never persisted across sessions.

### `OpticalMessageCodec`

Encodes and validates compact, versioned QR payloads as canonical JSON. Keys are serialized lexicographically with `JSONEncoder.OutputFormatting.sortedKeys`; coordinates and dimensions are signed integer millimeters, headings are signed integer millidegrees, and timestamps are Unix epoch milliseconds. The checksum is the first 16 bytes of SHA-256 over the UTF-8 canonical JSON with the checksum field omitted, encoded as lowercase hexadecimal.

Every message contains protocol version, mission UUID, message kind, a sequence that increases globally per sender, sender role, calibration marker ID, timestamp, message-specific body, and checksum. Message kinds are mission offer, acceptance, search commit, search-commit acknowledgement, rover status, rendezvous decision, convergence commit, and convergence-commit acknowledgement.

Except where a phase applies a narrower deadline, messages are stale 120 seconds after their timestamp and invalid more than 5 seconds in the future. The codec rejects malformed, stale, duplicated, out-of-order, wrong-role, wrong-marker, wrong-mission, and unsupported-version messages.

### `OpticalExchangeService`

Generates high-contrast QR images and scans QR observations from rear-camera frames. Optical exchanges are sequential: one rover displays while the other positions its rear camera toward that screen, then the rovers reverse presentation geometry. The service reports observations; the coordinator decides whether a message is valid for the current phase.

### `SectorExplorer`

Builds a costmap from the current AR mesh, obtains candidate frontiers, converts their centroids into the shared mission frame, and keeps only candidates in the assigned half-plane. A 0.25 m exclusion band around the center line prevents path jitter from producing accidental sector crossings.

Rebuilt frontier observations within 0.30 m of an existing mission candidate retain that candidate's identity. Visited and rejected state lasts for the mission. The explorer excludes visited, rejected, unreachable, and out-of-sector candidates, then sorts lexicographically by shortest safe path length ascending, frontier width descending, mission `x` ascending, and mission `y` ascending. This ordering is the deterministic ranking policy.

The explorer navigates to one frontier at a time, settles, performs a visual scan, then rebuilds the candidate set. A candidate with no safe path is rejected and exploration continues. Exhaustion returns the rover to rendezvous rather than crossing into its peer's sector.

`NavigationController` gains a path-admissibility policy applied to the initial plan and every periodic replan before wheel commands are sent. A path entering the center band or opposite sector is rejected with a distinct policy-failure result even when its destination remains in the correct sector.

### `TargetTracker`

Consumes RoverYOLO detections and LiDAR grounding. It considers at most one best matching detection per AR frame and confirms the configured canonical object class only after three detections from distinct frames within two seconds. Every accepted detection must have confidence at or above `0.90`, valid depth, and a shared-frame position within `0.35 m` of the component-wise median position.

The confirmed coordinate is that median. A first sighting, repeated inference over one frame, an ungrounded detection, or a differently labelled object never triggers return or reporting.

## Mission State Machine

### 1. Setup

The operator selects Rover A or Rover B, a target from model-supported classes, and a search duration. The app requires normal AR tracking, a loaded detector, and an available rover command link before calibration.

### 2. Calibration

Each rover scans the same physical floor marker independently. The coordinator stores the resulting `SharedMissionFrame` and marker ID. A failed quality check remains in calibration and explains which criterion failed.

### 3. Handshake

The app guides a four-message exchange:

1. Rover A displays a mission offer containing target, role assignment, marker ID, sector policy, search duration, and rendezvous geometry. Rover B scans and validates it.
2. Rover B displays acceptance with its complementary role, calibration identity, and wall-clock reading. Rover A scans and validates it.
3. Rover A displays a search commit with a start time at least 30 seconds in the future and an absolute deadline. Rover B scans it.
4. Rover B displays a search-commit acknowledgement containing the commit hash. Rover A scans it.

The handshake rejects clock disagreement greater than two seconds. Rover A must accept the acknowledgement at least five seconds before the committed start or abort the schedule and issue a new commit. Both coordinators wait until the acknowledged start time before moving. The operator-facing screens expose whether each side has accepted the schedule; v1 does not claim Byzantine or packet-loss-resistant consensus over an optical channel.

### 4. Search

Each rover performs one settled initial scan, then repeats:

1. Check the deadline and safety state.
2. Confirm or reject current target observations.
3. Build and sector-filter the frontier set.
4. Select the highest-ranked safe unvisited frontier.
5. Navigate to it through a path that remains in-sector.
6. Settle, scan, and mark the frontier visited.

The loop ends when the target is confirmed, no eligible frontier remains, the deadline expires, or a terminal safety failure occurs. A finder records the target and returns immediately. A rover that exhausts its sector returns and waits.

### 5. Return and Rendezvous

The fixed rendezvous staging positions are Rover A at `(-0.60 m, -0.80 m)` and Rover B at `(+0.60 m, -0.80 m)` in the shared frame, each with 0.20 m position tolerance. They sit south of a marker whose arrow points into the search space. For an optical scan of Rover B's screen, both rovers rotate their rear cameras east so B's screen faces A; for an optical scan of Rover A's screen, both rotate west. Rotation uses a 10-degree heading tolerance.

Each rover navigates to its own staging position and remains stopped. If a staging pose or its path is unsafe, the mission fails; v1 does not search for an alternate rendezvous pose. A finder waits until the peer arrives or until 60 seconds after the deadline.

### 6. Status and Report Exchange

The app exchanges status in role order. Rover A first displays its status; Rover B scans it. Rover B then displays its own status plus the hash of A's status; Rover A scans it. A found status contains the canonical label, shared coordinate, sample count, and confidence summary.

Rover A deterministically selects the rendezvous result. If exactly one status contains a target, that report is selected. If both contain targets within 0.50 m, the selected coordinate is their component-wise median. If both contain targets farther apart, the mission fails as conflicting evidence. If neither contains a target, the result is terminal not-found.

Rover A displays a rendezvous-decision message containing both status hashes and the selected result; Rover B scans it. For convergence, Rover A then displays a convergence commit at least 30 seconds in the future, Rover B scans and displays a hash acknowledgement, and Rover A scans that acknowledgement at least five seconds before release. The same acknowledged-decision mechanism carries terminal not-found without movement.

### 7. Convergence

The role-specific stand-off positions are fixed in the shared frame: Rover A targets `0.60 m` west of the selected coordinate and Rover B targets `0.60 m` east of it. Each faces the selected coordinate. Position tolerance is 0.20 m and heading tolerance is 10 degrees. If either pose or path is unsafe, that rover fails; v1 does not search for an alternate stand-off pose.

Each rover converts its stand-off pose into its local AR frame, waits for the acknowledged convergence time, navigates through normal safety controls, and turns to face the target. A rover displays `FOUND` only after its own motion reaches both tolerances.

### 8. Completion

The coordinator records a terminal success, not-found result, operator abort, partner timeout, protocol failure, calibration invalidation, or navigation/safety failure. Terminal states stop the rover and remain visible until the operator resets the mission.

## Safety and Recovery

Decision precedence is:

1. Operator Stop or emergency stop.
2. Existing obstacle, communication, and progress safety plus coordinator-enforced AR tracking safety.
3. Calibration and shared-frame validity.
4. Optical protocol validity.
5. Mission deadline and rendezvous rules.
6. Exploration and convergence actions.

Additional behavior:

- Limited AR tracking immediately cancels active navigation and keeps the rover stopped. If normal tracking returns within five seconds, the coordinator may replan from the current pose before resuming the same phase; otherwise it terminates the mission and invalidates calibration.
- An AR session reset always invalidates the shared frame.
- Deadline expiry cancels active exploration and begins return.
- A frontier planning failure rejects only that candidate; a transport, reactive-safety, or active-navigation failure terminates the mission.
- Every optical step times out after 30 seconds and offers Retry or Abort. Retry never advances sequence state until a valid message is scanned.
- A missing peer keeps the waiting rover stopped. The mission fails 60 seconds after the search deadline.
- Neither rover begins convergence until both statuses, the rendezvous decision, the convergence commit, and its acknowledgement are complete.
- No fallback permits crossing the assigned sector, accepting a lower-confidence target, or moving with an invalid shared frame.

## Operator Experience

The app adds a `Silent Search` tab with phase-specific screens:

- **Setup:** role, supported target class, duration, and readiness checks.
- **Calibration:** marker identity, sample progress, tracking state, and quality diagnostics.
- **Optical exchange:** either a full-screen QR or scanner state with explicit physical positioning instructions.
- **Search:** sector, remaining time, current frontier, visited/rejected counts, rover pose, and target-confirmation progress.
- **Rendezvous:** staging-pose progress and the next report/acknowledgement action.
- **Convergence:** reported target and navigation state.
- **Terminal:** full-screen `FOUND`, `NOT FOUND`, or an exact failure reason.

A persistent red Stop control is present in every moving phase. Waiting states explicitly say that the rover is stopped intentionally.

The functional map displays the marker origin and heading, sector boundary, local rover pose, eligible/visited/rejected frontiers, rendezvous staging poses, planned path, and confirmed target. It does not merge full AR meshes between devices.

## Telemetry

Structured runtime logs include:

- mission UUID and local role;
- coordinator state transitions;
- calibration sample quality and accepted transform;
- QR message kind, sequence, validation outcome, and rejection reason;
- frontier discovery, sector rejection, ranking, path rejection, visit, and exhaustion;
- target observation confidence, grounding result, cluster decision, and confirmation;
- deadline, return, rendezvous, report, acknowledgement, and convergence events;
- terminal result and safety reason.

Logs do not store camera images or complete QR payloads.

## Delivery Boundaries

This is one cohesive product specification but is delivered as six independently testable implementation slices, in order:

1. Shared-frame math and synthetic calibration validation.
2. Canonical optical messages and the complete acknowledged exchange protocol.
3. Sector path policy, deterministic frontier selection, and target tracking.
4. Coordinator state machine with a two-rover in-memory simulation.
5. Device calibration/scanning adapters and the operator UI.
6. Two-device integration and hardware acceptance.

Each slice must leave tests passing and expose no unfinished behavior through the app. Slice 6 is a hardware release gate: code completion can be reported separately, but the feature is not declared device-verified until the two-rover checklist passes.

## Testing Strategy

Implementation is test-first wherever behavior does not require physical hardware.

### Unit Tests

- Round-trip every QR message and reject altered checksums, stale timestamps, duplicate sequences, wrong roles, markers, and missions.
- Convert points and poses between AR-local and shared frames in both directions.
- Accept and reject calibration sample sets at each quality boundary.
- Filter frontier destinations and full paths against west/east sectors and the center exclusion band.
- Rank reachable, visited, rejected, and exhausted frontiers deterministically.
- Confirm only clustered, depth-grounded, high-confidence detections and compute their median coordinate.
- Verify the fixed role-specific rendezvous and target stand-off poses, tolerances, and unsafe-pose failure behavior.
- Exercise every valid and invalid coordinator transition, deadline, timeout, retry, abort, and terminal state.

### Coordinator Tests

Run two coordinators with fake clocks, perception, motion, and an in-memory optical relay. Cover:

- complete handshake and synchronized start;
- Rover A or Rover B as the sole finder;
- matching and conflicting dual reports;
- neither rover finding the target;
- sector exhaustion before deadline;
- duplicate and out-of-order optical messages;
- missing search-commit acknowledgement, rendezvous decision, convergence commit, or convergence-commit acknowledgement;
- partner rendezvous timeout;
- calibration invalidation and safety-stop propagation.

### UI Tests

- Configuration and readiness gating.
- Calibration cannot advance without accepted samples.
- Presentation/scanning phases and Retry/Abort controls.
- Persistent Stop access during every moving phase.
- Intentional-waiting, not-found, success, and exact failure displays.

### Device Verification

- Use two iPhone Pros, each connected only to its own rover AP.
- Disable cloud-dependent app configuration and use airplane mode where compatible with rover Wi-Fi.
- Verify both phones calibrate to the same marker and agree on test points.
- Verify both paths remain in their sectors during timed frontier search.
- Test each rover as finder, complete the optical report exchange, and confirm both converge without cross-device radio traffic.
- Pull logs and verify calibration, protocol sequence, target evidence, rendezvous, convergence, and terminal status.

## Non-Goals

- Survivor takeover after a rover misses rendezvous.
- VLM-negotiated sector assignment.
- Full map or AR-mesh transfer and map merging.
- Cloud, Bluetooth, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, or `RoverTeamRadio` coordination.
- Arbitrary object classes or model training.
- Persistent calibration across AR sessions.
- Multiple search/rendezvous rounds.
- Operation without the shared printed marker.
